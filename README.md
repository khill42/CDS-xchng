Click [**Use this template**](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/generate) button above for the quickest method of getting started with the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).

Contains basic configuration to get you a site with:

- Sample posts.
- Sample top navigation.
- Sample author sidebar with social links.
- Sample footer links.
- Paginated home page.
- Archive pages for posts grouped by year, category, and tag.
- Sample about page.
- Sample 404 page.
- Site wide search.

Replace sample content with your own and [configure as necessary](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/).

 Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
